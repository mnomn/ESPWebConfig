# ESPWebConfig
Arduino web based configuration library for ESP8266 chip.

Configure the device in a web inteface. After first boot it will act as an access point,
so you don't need ssid and password hardcoded in your program.
Define parameters names in your code, and they will show up in
web config, for example SSID and Wifi password.

After config and reboot, you can read parameter values and use them in your program.
